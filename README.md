# CPTR-309 Team 2 Final Project

## Welcome
Hello and welcome to our Software Enginerring team project. Over a three month period we have been working on developing a 3D Simulated Printer that not only meets our class requirement, but will also assist in the future learning and comprehension of 3D printers to anyone who views this project. We look forward to see what more you do with this code in the future.
